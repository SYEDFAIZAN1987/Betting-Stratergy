## 📘 About the Project

This project analyzes betting strategies in a best-of-three and best-of-five series between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees. The analysis evaluates the **probability of winning the series**, **expected net wins**, and the **effectiveness of different betting strategies**. Statistical methods and simulations are used to draw meaningful insights into the profitability and risks of the betting strategy.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

1. **Evaluate Probabilities**:
   - Use theoretical probabilities to calculate series outcomes for the Red Sox.
2. **Construct Net Win Distributions**:
   - Calculate expected net win, variance, and standard deviation for various scenarios.
3. **Simulations**:
   - Run 10,000 simulations to model the risk and validate theoretical results.
4. **Goodness-of-Fit Tests**:
   - Use chi-squared tests to determine how well observed results align with theoretical distributions.
5. **Summarize Insights**:
   - Compare strategies to assess which is most favorable and under what conditions.

## 📊 Key Results

### **Best-of-Three Series**
- **Probability of Red Sox Winning**: 56.64%
- **Expected Net Win**: $57.89
- **Risk**: High standard deviation of $795.15 reflects substantial variability in outcomes.
- **Simulation Results**: Confidence interval [44.25, 75.59] includes the expected value.

### **Best-of-Five Series**
- **Probability of Red Sox Winning**: 56.09%
- **Expected Net Win**: $76.35
- **Risk**: Even higher standard deviation of $1024.73 highlights significant variability.
- **Simulation Results**: Confidence interval [39.98, 80.43] aligns with theoretical expectations.

## 📜 Summary of Findings

- **Best-of-Three Strategy**: Slightly favorable with an expected win, but high risk due to variability.
- **Best-of-Five Strategy**: More favorable with a higher expected win, though the risk remains significant.
- **Insights**:
  - **High Standard Deviation**: Indicates caution due to the variability in outcomes.
  - **Simulation Alignment**: Observed results align well with theoretical expectations, as confirmed by the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test.
